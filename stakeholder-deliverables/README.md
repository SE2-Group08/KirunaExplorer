# Stakeholder Deliverables

This directory contains all the necessary files and instructions for deploying and running the Kiruna Explorer application. Each release has its own subdirectory with specific configuration and documentation.

## Structure

- **`release-1/`**:
    - Files for Release 1 of the Kiruna Explorer application.
    - Includes:
        - `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose file for deploying the application.
        - `.env.example`: Template for environment variables.
        - `DEPLOYMENT.md`: Detailed instructions for deployment.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the appropriate release directory.
2. Follow the instructions in the `DEPLOYMENT.md` file within that directory.

## Future Releases

As new releases are prepared, additional subdirectories (e.g., `release-2/`) will be added here with updated files and instructions.
